This is a very basic static website generator written in Ruby for use when 
even a tool such as nanoc is too complex for your needs.  

I wrote it as I needed a very simple tool that could allow me to create basic
static website of a few pages from a common template.

Usage: 

$ ruby generate.rb 
Generated ./output/download.html
Generated ./output/index.html
Copied resource files

This will generate a basic example website in the directory ./output
